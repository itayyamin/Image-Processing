This script is a collection of functions for manipulating images in Python. It uses the NumPy and skimage libraries for image processing and representation. It allows the user to read and display images, convert images between color spaces, and perform image quantization. It also provides functions for calculating the histogram and cumulative histogram of an image. The script enables the user to perform histogram equalization and other operations on images. Examples of the output of histogram equalization and quantization, as well as other functions, can be seen in the provided examples folder.
